## Sublime Text 2 - Build System

I love the Sublime-Text-2 Build-System feature. Simply hit [Command]-B (Mac OS) or [CTRL]-B (Win?/Lin?) and your file named *my-template.tpl* will be compiled into *my-template.pistachio*. This way development is pretty seamless. Just hit "Build" in Sublime-Text-2 which will also save the file, and you are good to go again.

**Install:**

Open Sublime-Text-2 and in the *Preferences* Menu choose *Browse Packagesâ€¦*. Then copy the file *Pistachio.sublime-build* into the *User* folder there and you are done.
